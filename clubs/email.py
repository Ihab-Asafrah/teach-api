%(username)s,

You did it! You put your city on the map and showed your dedication to increasing web literacy around the world. This is a big first step, so thank you for all that you are doing to teach the web.

Whether you are a new club leader or an expert at running clubs, we recommend you get started by meeting others in our community. Join the conversation on our discussion forum [http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs], or tell us what you're teaching on Twitter using hashtag #teachtheweb.

A member of our team will send you an email soon to see how you're doing and make sure your club is on the road to success!

Michelle Thorne
on behalf of the Mozilla Learning team

p.s. Be sure to check out our tips for running clubs [link to page that will be built in #255]. They'll help you get support, find training opportunities, increase the impact of your club, and much more.
